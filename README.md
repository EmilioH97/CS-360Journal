Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
This project was meant for me to learn how to use the android studio to develop an application from design to development.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful
I needed to make a login screen, apop up screen, and main task screen. I wanted to create an easy to follow screen that used design recommendations to create a greate user experience.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I broke the project into smaller sections for myself to complete to build upon each to create the finished project. This will be a practice I take with me forever into my career.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I used the android studio debug system to check with the android devices to ensure compatibility and build purpose.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I needed to change the plan for my design to make developing a easier task for myself.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I did well create a design that was both appealing and functional that followed the android studio design recommendations.
